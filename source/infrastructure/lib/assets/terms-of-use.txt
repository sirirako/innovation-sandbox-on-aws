The Innovation Sandbox on AWS ("ISB") allows you to experiment with AWS resources in non-production accounts. Customers are responsible for making their own independent assessment of the information in this document. This document: (a) is for informational purposes only, (b) represents AWS current product offerings and practices, which are subject to change without notice, and (c) does not create any commitments or assurances from AWS and its affiliates, suppliers or licensors. AWS products or services including ISB are provided "as is" and AWS does not make any warranties, representations, or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied about ISB. AWS responsibilities and liabilities to its customers are controlled by AWS agreements, and this document is not part of, nor does it modify, any agreement between AWS and its customers.

You assume all responsibility for your use of ISB and making your own independent assessments of ISB, as well as any compliance with any additional terms, licenses, laws, rules, regulations, policies, or standards that apply to you, and, your use of ISB is subject to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model.

These Terms of Use supplement, and do not modify, any other existing agreements between you and AWS.

* Non-Production Environments Only: The ISB solution is for use only for experiments in a non-production environment and may make irreversible changes to your environment, such as terminating AWS resources. It is not for use in production accounts.
* Limitations of Cost Control Mechanisms: AWS makes no guarantees that usage cost will never exceed the budget limit set in ISB, and ISB may not prevent spend from going over the budget in all cases.
* May Not Terminate All AWS Resources: In certain limited situations, ISB may not delete all AWS Resources and AWS will attempt to notify you that manual intervention is necessary for these accounts. These accounts could continue to incur costs until manually resolved by you. AWS makes no guarantees regarding the automatic termination of these resources by ISB and you are responsible for all fees in cases where ISB does not automatically terminate resources.
* No Third-Party Use: ISB allows you to provide your own AWS accounts to internal end-users for learning and experimentation. You may not provide your AWS accounts to third-party users (such as other companies or public users) as this may grant third-party users access to your AWS resources.
* Manually Adding New Users: If you have manually added additional users to an AWS account which has already been granted to a sandbox user by ISB, it is your responsibility to ensure deletion of the userâ€™s access after their sandbox use.
* Fraud and Abuse Detection: You are responsible for monitoring your sandbox account to detect any cases of potential fraud, abuse, or misuse.
