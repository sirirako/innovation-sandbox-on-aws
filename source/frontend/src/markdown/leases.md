The **Leases** page displays all the leases currently in your sandbox environment.

**Leases**: A lease is a temporary assignment of an AWS account to a user for a specified budget and duration.

**Lease Template**: A lease template defines the conditions that govern the use of the account - such as approval for a user to use a given account, budget and threshold actions, lease duration and threshold actions.

**Status**: State that is maintained by the solution throughout itâ€™s sandbox usage lifecycle. Refer to the [Account states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/use-the-solution.html#understand-states) section.
